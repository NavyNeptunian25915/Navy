    <h2>Pieces Movement</h2>
    <p>There are eight types of pieces in the board, (Captain, Battleship, Tank, Submarine, Jet, Helicopter, Soldier).</p>
    <p>Captain Movement: Knight.</p>
    <p>Battleship Movement: Queen.</p>
    <p>Tank (Capture but Movement): (Rook but Knight).</p>
    <p>Submarine (Capture but Movement): (Bishop but Knight).</p>
    <p>Jet (Capture but Movement): (Knight but Rook).</p>
    <p>Helicopter (Capture but Movement): (Knight but Bishop).</p>
    <p>Soldier (Capture but Movement): (1-2 squares forward straight but 1-2 squares forward diagonal).</p>
    <p>There is promotion logic, they can promote into any piece but a captain, but if it lands on the “H” column then it will automatically promote only into a captain, that is ONLY when the old captain is captured, otherwise it cannot move in the last row IN the “H” column.</p>
